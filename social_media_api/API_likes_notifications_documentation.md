### How to Interact with the Like and Notification Features

1. **Liking a Post**: 
   - Use the `POST /posts/<int:pk>/like/` endpoint to like a post.
   - The post author will receive a notification indicating that you liked their post.
   
2. **Unliking a Post**: 
   - Use the `POST /posts/<int:pk>/unlike/` endpoint to unlike a post.
   - The like will be removed, and no further notifications will be sent for that action.

3. **Notifications**: 
   - Users can view all their notifications using the `GET /notifications/` endpoint.
   - To mark a notification as read, use the `POST /notifications/<int:pk>/read/` endpoint.

## Notes
- Make sure to include a valid authorization token in the header for authenticated requests.
- The notifications system is designed to handle different types of actions, including likes, comments, and follows. You can extend it to support more types of notifications as needed.
